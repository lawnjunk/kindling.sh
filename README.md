Kindling.sh
===========
Kindling.sh is basic bashrc with some convient features for new shell users!

## Getting Started

* `git` should be installed on your computer
* [Git Aware Prompt](https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt)

## What am i getting?
### Color Coding
Color coded output of your commands is a vitial tool for learning to read the output of your programs. Staring as pages of all white on black text is extreamly dawnting. When you know what your looking for its like finding a neadle in a hay stack, and when you dont what your looking for its all just a bunch of random meaningless text. Color can help you register important details, as well as keep track of what your looking at. `kindling.sh` enables color coding on some of the programs you will find yourself using most often.  

### Prompt
Your prompt will now be color coded. It will also let you know what git branch you are working in!  

### Ls
Ls now has some handy short cuts. 
* `ls` will now be in color
* `la` is now aliased to run `ls -a`
* `ll` is now aliased to run `ls -lah`
* `l` is now aliased to run `ls -1`  

### Man Pages
Man pages will now be in color!
